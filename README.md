# Norway Olympic Predictor

## Overview

The **Norway Olympic Predictor** is an advanced Machine Learning solution designed to forecast the number of medals Norway is expected to win in future Olympic Games. By analyzing historical Olympic performance data alongside key socio-economic indicators—such as GDP, HDI, and population—the model leverages a Random Forest algorithm to generate highly accurate predictions (R² score of 0.94).

## Technical Foundation

The model is built upon a robust data pipeline:

*   **Historical Data:** Comprehensive datasets of medal counts from Norway and competing nations.
*   **Socio-Economic Indicators:** Integration of GDP, Human Development Index (HDI), and population statistics.
*   **Machine Learning Algorithm:** A tuned Random Forest regressor optimized for predictive accuracy.
*   **Data Processing:** Advanced preprocessing techniques for outlier treatment, feature engineering, and data normalization.

## Use Cases
