    "### Final Report\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Predict the number of medals a country can win in the next Olympics based on historical Olympic performance data, socio-economic indicators, and other relevant factors.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Objective**: Develop a predictive model to estimate the number of medals each country may win in the next Olympics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sub-objectives**:\n",
    "  1. Analyze the relationship between socio-economic variables (GDP, HDI, population) and Olympic performance.\n",
    "  2. Compare different machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective for predicting medals.\n",
    "  3. Generate insights into how government policies and socio-economic conditions influence Olympic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Warehouse Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The study's data was extracted from four primary sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GDP by Country 1999-2022.csv**: Historical GDP data by country from 1999 to 2022.\n",
    "2. **Human Development Index - Full.csv**: Includes HDI and other human development indicators like gender inequality, life expectancy, and more.\n",
    "3. **olympics_medals_country_wise.csv**: Provides the number of medals won by each country in both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\n",
    "4. **population_by_country_2020.csv**: Contains population data by country for the year 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Merging**:\n",
    "- The data was combined using the country name or ISO code (when available). Merging these datasets created a unified dataset with information on Olympic performance, GDP, HDI, and population data for each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation Between GDP and Medals**: Countries with higher GDP tend to win more medals in the Olympics. This can be explained by increased investment in sports infrastructure, athlete training, and development programs.\n",
    "- **Impact of HDI**: Countries with a higher HDI generally perform better in the Olympics, suggesting that factors like life expectancy, education, and per capita income influence sports success.\n",
    "- **Population Influence**: Population size is also a significant factor. Countries with larger populations have more potential athletes, increasing their chances of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Taken**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Values**: Rows with missing data were removed to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- **Normalization**: GDP, HDI, and population were normalized to bring all variables to the same scale.\n",
    "- **Data Merging**: The datasets were combined based on the country name or ISO code, creating a unified dataset for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Preprocessing Code**:\n",

    "population_df[['Population']] = scaler.fit_transform(population_df[['Population']])\n",
    "hdi_df[['Human Development Index']] = scaler.fit_transform(hdi_df[['Human Development Index']])\n",
    "\n",

    "### 8. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The models show that Random Forest is the most effective for predicting the number of medals, with the lowest MAE and MSE and the highest R². This suggests that machine learning techniques that capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions are better suited for this type of prediction. Additionally, the use of socio-economic variables like GDP, HDI, and population proved essential for understanding countries' Olympic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The study's objectives were successfully achieved. We developed an effective predictive model (Random Forest) to predict the number of medals using historical and socio-economic data. The study revealed that factors like GDP, HDI, and population significantly influence Olympic performance. Throughout the project, we learned the importance of merging data from different sources and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to find the best fit. The analysis demonstrated that the Random Forest model, with fine-tuned hyperparameters, was the best approach for medal prediction, showing robustness and high accuracy in the results."
